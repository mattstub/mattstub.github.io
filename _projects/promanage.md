---

ProManage is a comprehensive construction management tool suite I'm developing to solve real problems I encounter daily at Matthews Plumbing.

## The Problem

Creating submittals for construction projects is incredibly time-consuming:
- Reviewing 100+ page specification documents
- Extracting submittal requirements manually
- Gathering manufacturer documentation
- Formatting everything properly

This process currently takes **30-60 minutes per submittal**, and we handle multiple submittals across many projects annually.

## The Solution

ProManage automates this workflow:

1. **PDF Parsing** - Extracts submittal requirements from specification PDFs
2. **Automated Documentation** - Gathers manufacturer docs automatically
3. **Template Generation** - Creates properly formatted submittal packages
4. **Time Savings** - Reduces submittal creation to 2-5 minutes

### Potential Impact

If successful, this could save **hundreds of hours annually** across our construction projects.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** - Core automation logic
- **PDF Processing** - Text extraction and parsing
- **Modular Architecture** - Designed to house multiple tools
- **Open Source** - Planning to release components publicly

## Current Status

The project is in active development. I'm documenting the journey through blog posts on this site, covering:

- Architecture decisions
- Technical challenges
- Implementation details
- Lessons learned
