# Michael Jackson Allegations: A Comprehensive Look

Whether you believe Michael Jackson was a creep, a troubled individual or just a misunderstood soul probably has a lot of bearing in how you understand the story of the allegations he faced during his life. That perspective and your williningness to be told a narrative by the Main Stream Media shape what most people remember or understand about the whole situation. I will admit I was definitely a person who originally took everything at face value and took anything the news told me as truth. But with everything going on recently between the media, government and watching people in powerful circles operate in a different landscape, it seemed like a topic revisiting.

The recent shit show that has been playing out in the U.S. right now with the Epstein Files has me realizing that there is a small group of people in this country that have been feeding us misinformation and narratives for years. So instead of falling off every deep social media wormhole as I usually have done to waste my time through the years. I've decided its time to use the power of A.I. to join the Researcher front. This collection of writings and Research Briefs will hopefully give people an area where they can come to get quick information and can make their own mind up about what might have happened.

This is a story that we will never truly have the answers for, so instead of going into this collection of work thinking there will be a definitive answer listed. Use the information to figure out your own opinions on the matter and understand that the real story is somewhere in the middle of what we were told and what we weren't told. It's important to remember that Michael Jackson was never convicted of any crime related to child abuse. Although he faced multiple allegations throughout his life (a handful emerging after his death by people who previously defended him), he was acquitted in a 2005 criminal trial, and settled one civil case in 1993. 

I hope you find something informative in this research or learn something different than what you were originally told. Where applicable in research excerpts I will do my best to cite reputable sources, and if it is an opinion article not of my own writing I will make sure that is clearly stated.

Enjoy!
