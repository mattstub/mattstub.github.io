# Foster Care in Oklahoma

Some of you may know, that during 2020 we decided to start our journey into becoming foster parents. We recognized that there are a lot of families struggling in Oklahoma and a huge shortage of providers willing to help Children through the foster program. So we took a leap of faith and jumped in.

Below you will find a collectio of any writings or research that I have put together that touches on this subject. Often times even with the best resources and agencies in the system you may feel as if you just don't have the specific support for what you are dealing with. So maybe you will find something in this collection. I have tried to empower AI to help in ways in life, and have found that using it to do the searching and compiling on some specific things has made things a bit easier.

This is an ongoing collection of resources and writings that I hope to be adding to as time goes.
