Dear [Director's Name]:

I am writing to formally request a comprehensive special education evaluation 
for my [son/daughter], [Child's Full Name], who is currently enrolled in 
[grade] at [School Name]. [His/Her] teacher is [Teacher's Name].

I am concerned that [Child's Name] may have a disability that is adversely 
affecting [his/her] educational performance. [Child's Name] has been diagnosed 
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which significantly impacts 
[his/her] ability to focus and learn in the classroom environment.

Specifically, I have observed the following difficulties:
- Inability to concentrate or maintain focus during instruction
- [Add specific examples: difficulty completing assignments, behavioral 
  responses to triggers, social/emotional challenges, attendance issues, etc.]
- [Any documented incidents or teacher observations]
- [Impact on grades, participation, peer relationships]

We have tried [mention any interventions already attempted, if applicable], 
but [Child's Name] continues to struggle significantly. I am requesting a full 
individual evaluation under IDEA to determine eligibility for special education 
services under the category of Emotional Disturbance.

I am requesting that the evaluation include assessments in the following areas:
- Social/emotional functioning
- Behavioral assessment (including Functional Behavioral Assessment if appropriate)
- Academic achievement
- Cognitive functioning
- Classroom observation
- Review of medical/mental health records
- Any other areas the team deems appropriate

I understand that the school district must respond to this request and that, 
if approved, the evaluation must be completed within Oklahoma's timeline of 
45 school days from the date I sign consent for evaluation.

**Please note:** I am requesting this evaluation under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Any general education interventions (such 
as Response to Intervention/RTI) should not delay the evaluation timeline 
established under federal law. I understand that intervention data may be 
collected as part of the evaluation process within the required timeline.

Enclosed are copies of:
- [Medical diagnosis of PTSD]
- [Therapy/treatment records]
- [Teacher observations/emails]
- [Other relevant documentation]

I am available to discuss this request and answer any questions. You may reach 
me at [phone number] or [email]. I look forward to working collaboratively with 
the team to support [Child's Name]'s educational needs.

Sincerely,

RE: Request for Special Education Evaluation
Student: [Child's Full Name]
DOB: [Child's Date of Birth]
Current School: [School Name]
Grade: [Current Grade]

Dear [Director's Name]:

I am writing to formally request a comprehensive special education evaluation 
for [Child's Full Name], who is currently enrolled in [grade] at [School Name]. 
[His/Her] teacher is [Teacher's Name].

**My Authority to Make This Request:**

I am [Child's Name]'s foster parent, and [he/she] is currently in the custody 
of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS). Under Oklahoma DHS Policy 
340:75-6-50(f) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), I 
am authorized to act in place of the parent to represent [Child's Name]'s 
educational interests. [His/Her] biological parent is [unable to participate/
unavailable/rights have been terminated - choose applicable phrase]. 

I am making this request in coordination with [Child's Name]'s DHS Child 
Welfare Specialist, [CW Specialist Name], who can be reached at [phone number] 
or [email address] should you need to verify my authority to make educational 
decisions for [Child's Name].

**Basis for Evaluation Request:**

I am concerned that [Child's Name] has a disability that is adversely affecting 
[his/her] educational performance. [Child's Name] has been diagnosed with 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by [diagnosing provider/agency], which 
significantly impacts [his/her] ability to focus and learn in the classroom 
environment.

Under Oklahoma DHS Policy 340:75-6-50.4(c)(2), Child Welfare Services is 
required to ensure an immediate request for IEP services when a child has, or 
is suspected of having, a diagnosis of emotional disturbance, which includes 
PTSD and anxiety disorders.

**Specific Educational Concerns:**

Since [Child's Name] has been in my care [length of time], I have observed the 
following difficulties that impact [his/her] educational performance:

- Inability to concentrate or maintain focus during instruction
- [Difficulty completing assignments or schoolwork]
- [Behavioral responses to trauma triggers in school setting]
- [Social/emotional challenges with peers or teachers]
- [Attendance issues related to trauma symptoms]
- [Anxiety or avoidance behaviors related to school]
- [Impact on grades - specific subjects if known]
- [Difficulty with transitions or changes in routine]
- [Other specific observable behaviors]

**Interventions Attempted:**

[If applicable, mention: "The school has tried [list interventions], but 
[Child's Name] continues to struggle significantly." OR "To date, no specific 
interventions have been implemented to address these concerns."]

Additionally, [Child's Name] is receiving [therapy/counseling/psychiatric 
services - if applicable] to address the PTSD, but [he/she] continues to 
require additional support in the educational setting.

**Evaluation Request:**

I am requesting a full and individual evaluation under IDEA to determine 
eligibility for special education services under the category of Emotional 
Disturbance. I am requesting that the evaluation include comprehensive 
assessments in the following areas:

- Social/emotional functioning
- Behavioral assessment, including Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) 
  to identify triggers and appropriate interventions
- Academic achievement in all areas
- Cognitive functioning
- Adaptive behavior and daily living skills
- Classroom observation in the educational setting
- Review of medical/mental health records and trauma history (as appropriate)
- Assessment of how PTSD symptoms impact learning and school performance
- Any other areas the multidisciplinary team deems necessary

**Timeline and Legal Requirements:**

I understand that the school district must respond to this request in writing. 
If approved, I understand that the evaluation must be completed within 
Oklahoma's timeline of 45 school days from the date I sign consent for the 
evaluation.

**Important Notice Regarding Response to Intervention (RTI):**

I am requesting this evaluation under the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA). Please be advised that any general education interventions 
(such as Response to Intervention/RTI) should NOT delay the evaluation timeline 
established under federal law. While I understand that intervention data may be 
collected as part of the evaluation process, such data collection must occur 
within the required 45-school-day timeline and must not postpone the initiation 
of the evaluation. Under IDEA, parents have the right to request an evaluation 
at any time, regardless of RTI status.

**Documentation Enclosed:**

I am enclosing the following documentation to support this request:

- [Copy of PTSD diagnosis from mental health provider]
- [Therapy or counseling records, if available and appropriate to share]
- [Medical or psychiatric records relevant to the diagnosis]
- [Teacher observations, emails, or progress reports]
- [Behavioral incident reports from school, if any]
- [Report cards or academic records showing impact on performance]
- [DHS placement information and case contact information]
- [Any previous educational evaluations or assessments]
- [Other relevant documentation]

**Contact Information and Coordination:**

I am available to discuss this request, provide additional information, and 
participate in all meetings related to this evaluation. You may reach me at:

Phone: [Your phone number]
Email: [Your email address]
Best times to reach me: [Days/times]

For verification of my authority to make educational decisions for [Child's 
Name] or for coordination regarding [his/her] case, please contact:

DHS Child Welfare Specialist: [CW Specialist Name]
Phone: [CW Specialist phone]
Email: [CW Specialist email]
DHS Office: [Office location/address]

I look forward to working collaboratively with the IEP team to ensure that

special education services and supports [he/she] needs to be successful in 
school despite the challenges posed by [his/her] trauma history.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. Please provide me with 
written notice of your decision regarding this evaluation request and, if 
approved, the consent forms necessary to begin the evaluation process.

2. **Be as specific as possible** about behavioral and academic concerns you've observed
3. **Attach strong documentation** - medical diagnosis is especially important

## Timeline and What to Expect

### Oklahoma-Specific Timelines

|Event|Timeline|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Submit written request|Day 0|Starts the process|
|School response|ASAP|Written Notice of agreement or refusal|
|Review of Existing Data (RED) meeting|Within 10 school days of consent|Team reviews current information|
|Sign Consent for Evaluation|After RED meeting|Starts 45-day clock|
|Complete Evaluation|45 school days from consent|All testing must be finished|
|Eligibility Meeting|After evaluation complete|Team determines if child qualifies|
|IEP Development (if eligible)|Within 30 calendar days of eligibility|First IEP must be created|

### Important Timeline Considerations

**End of School Year:** If you request an evaluation late in the school year (fewer than 45 school days remaining), the evaluation may not be completed until the next school year begins. Request as early as possible.

**RTI Cannot Delay Evaluation:** Schools cannot require your child to complete Response to Intervention (RTI) before conducting a special education evaluation. IDEA gives parents the right to request an evaluation at any time, regardless of RTI status.

**45 School Days = Working Days Only:** Weekends, holidays, school breaks, and summer vacation do NOT count toward the 45-day timeline.

## Documentation Checklist

## Your Rights as a Parent

### You Have the Right To:

1. **Request an evaluation at any time** - regardless of RTI or other interventions
2. **Receive the evaluation at no cost** - the school district must pay
3. **Give or refuse consent** - evaluation cannot proceed without your written permission
4. **Participate in all meetings** - you are a required member of the IEP team
5. **Review all educational records** - before and during the evaluation
6. **Receive results before the eligibility meeting** - you should get evaluation reports in advance
7. **Bring others to meetings** - advocates, therapists, family members
8. **Request an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE)** - if you disagree with the school's evaluation, you can request the district pay for an independent evaluation
9. **Disagree with the evaluation results** - and use dispute resolution options
10. **Request reevaluation** - at least once per year, and required at least every 3 years

### Critical Protections

**RTI Cannot Block Evaluation:** Federal law explicitly states that schools cannot require completion of Response to Intervention before evaluating for special education. Make this clear in your request letter.

**Medical Diagnosis Helps But Isn't Required:** A PTSD diagnosis from a doctor/therapist supports your request, but the school must also conduct educational assessments to determine if the condition affects educational performance.

**Procedural Safeguards:** When you make your request, the school must provide you with a copy of "Procedural Safeguards" - a document explaining all your rights under IDEA.

## Special Guidance for Foster Parents

### Your Rights as a Foster Parent in Oklahoma

If you are a foster parent in Oklahoma, you have specific rights and authority to request IEP evaluations and make educational decisions for children in your care.

**Good News: You CAN Submit This Paperwork**

Under Oklahoma law and DHS policy, foster parents may act in place of the parent to represent the child's educational interests when the parent is unable, unavailable, or unwilling to participate in the child's school arrangements.

### When Foster Parents Have Full Educational Rights

You have the same rights as a biological parent to:

- Request an IEP evaluation
- Sign consent for evaluation
- Attend all IEP meetings
- Sign the IEP
- Request services
- Examine all school records
- Participate in all educational decisions

**You do NOT need to be appointed as a "surrogate parent"** to exercise these rights - foster parents automatically have educational decision-making authority in Oklahoma.

### Oklahoma DHS Policy Support

Oklahoma DHS Policy 340:75-6-50.4(c)(2) specifically requires Child Welfare Services to:

- Coordinate with foster parents to assess the need for IEP services
- Ensure an immediate request for IEP services when a child has or is suspected of having emotional disturbance (which includes PTSD)
- Make all requests in writing by parent, foster parent, or other authorized party

**This means DHS should be helping you, not blocking you.**

### Who CANNOT Act as Educational Decision-Maker

DHS employees and other public agency employees may NOT act in place of a parent or sign an IEP. If you work for DHS or another public agency, you cannot be the educational decision-maker, but a regular foster parent absolutely can.

### Check the Child's Legal Status

Before submitting your request, understand the child's legal situation:

**Scenario 1: Biological parent's rights intact but parent is unavailable/unwilling**

- You can proceed - you act in place of the parent
- You sign all consent forms and attend all meetings

**Scenario 2: Biological parent's rights intact AND parent is involved**

- Ideally, coordinate with biological parent
- Biological parent retains primary rights
- You can still request evaluation, but parent must consent

**Scenario 3: Parental rights terminated or suspended**

- You can absolutely proceed
- You have full authority
- No coordination with biological parent needed

**Scenario 4: Court order specifically addresses educational rights**

- Follow what the court order says
- If order is unclear, contact your CW specialist

### Steps to Protect Yourself

**Before Submitting the Request:**

1. **Contact your DHS Child Welfare Specialist**
    
    - Inform them you're requesting an IEP evaluation
    - Ask if there are any court orders limiting educational decision-making
    - Request confirmation in writing that you can act as parent for educational purposes
    - Get their contact information to include in your letter
2. **Gather case documentation**
    
    - Court orders (if any) regarding custody and educational rights
    - DHS placement paperwork
    - Any existing educational records from DHS file
    - Medical/mental health records related to PTSD diagnosis
3. **Coordinate with the child's treatment team**
    
    - Therapist or counselor treating the PTSD
    - Case manager or other DHS staff
    - CASA volunteer if assigned

### Potential Obstacles and How to Handle Them

#### **Obstacle 1: School Questions Your Authority**

If school says: "We need permission from the biological parent"

Your response: "Under Oklahoma DHS Policy 340:75-6-50(f), foster parents may act in place of the parent to represent the child's educational interests when the parent is unable, unavailable, or unwilling to participate. I am exercising that authority. Please contact my DHS caseworker [name and number] if you need confirmation."

**What to do:**

- Refer them to your CW specialist for verification
- Provide a copy of the placement order (if you have it)
- Stand firm - you have the legal right
- If they continue to refuse, contact Oklahoma Parents Center for advocacy support

#### **Obstacle 2: DHS Employee Tries to Sign Instead of You**

If DHS employee says: "I'll handle the IEP paperwork"

Your response: "Oklahoma DHS policy specifically states that DHS employees and other public agency employees may not act in place of a parent or sign an IEP. As the foster parent, I have the authority and responsibility to act in place of the parent."

**What to do:**

- Politely decline and explain the policy
- Cite Oklahoma DHS Policy 340:75-6-50.4(d)(4) which prohibits DHS employees from signing IEPs
- Offer to keep them informed and copied on all correspondence
- Ask them to attend meetings as a support person, not as decision-maker

#### **Obstacle 3: Biological Parent Objects**

If biological parent says: "I didn't give permission for this"

**What to do:**

- Contact your CW specialist immediately
- This needs to be resolved through DHS and possibly court
- Do NOT proceed without clarification if parent has active rights
- Document the parent's objection
- However, if parent is unavailable or uninvolved, you still have authority

#### **Obstacle 4: You're Asked to Become "Surrogate Parent"**

What to know: You don't need formal surrogate parent appointment as a foster parent - you already have the rights.

However: Some schools may ask foster parents to complete surrogate parent training. This is free training provided by Oklahoma State Department of Education, and it can actually be helpful for understanding the process better. You can take it voluntarily, but it's not required to exercise your rights.

### Best Practices for Foster Parents

**Document Everything:**

- Keep copies of all communications with school
- Document conversations with DHS about educational rights
- Save all emails, letters, and notices
- Take notes at every meeting with dates and attendees

**Copy Your CW Specialist on Everything:**

- Include them on all correspondence with school
- Keep them informed of meeting dates and outcomes
- Request their attendance at important meetings
- Document their involvement (or lack thereof)

**Know Your Child's Background:**

- Understand the trauma history as much as is appropriate
- Know what triggers to share with school (with discretion)
- Be aware of any previous school challenges or IEPs
- Keep medical/mental health information organized

**Be Professional But Persistent:**

- Remain calm and respectful in all interactions
- Assert your rights clearly when necessary
- Follow up in writing after verbal conversations
- Don't be intimidated by "we can't do that" responses

**Protect the Child's Privacy:**

- Share only necessary information about trauma history
- Be mindful of sensitive details in written communication
- Ask schools to mark records as confidential where appropriate
- Balance transparency with the child's dignity

### Remember

As a foster parent, you are in a unique position to advocate for this child's educational needs. The child may have had disrupted education due to placement changes, trauma, or lack of advocacy in the past. Your willingness to pursue appropriate services could make a life-changing difference.

You have the legal authority to do this. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

## Important Reminders

### Critical Points to Remember

1. **Put everything in writing** - verbal requests don't create official timelines
2. **Keep copies of everything** - maintain complete records
3. **RTI cannot delay evaluation** - state this clearly in your letter
4. **You are a required team member** - attend all meetings
5. **Free services are available** - contact Oklahoma Parents Center
6. **Act quickly** - especially if late in school year
7. **Medical diagnosis helps** - but educational impact must also be shown
8. **You can disagree** - dispute resolution options exist

### What NOT to Do

- Don't wait for the school to suggest evaluation
- Don't accept "let's try RTI first" as a reason to delay
- Don't sign anything you don't understand
- Don't attend meetings without preparation
- Don't assume the school knows best - you know your child
- Don't give up if initially denied

### Key Legal Standards

**For IDEA Eligibility (Emotional Disturbance):** Child must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects educational performance:

- Inability to learn not explained by other factors
- Inability to build/maintain satisfactory relationships
- Inappropriate behavior or feelings under normal circumstances
- General pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression
- Tendency to develop physical symptoms/fears associated with personal or school problems

**PTSD Connection:** PTSD falls under anxiety disorders and can qualify under Emotional Disturbance if it meets the criteria above and adversely affects educational performance.
